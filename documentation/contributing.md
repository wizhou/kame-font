## Important notice

**The last version of all the font design is insde the font forge files**. You can find them in `sources/2-fontforge`. Always use these files as reference to export glyphs and to design new elements.

All the files presented in `/sources/1-drawing` are references to past design process and are shared as Adobe Illustrator file, thus not free software elements. **Do not use theses file to design.**
